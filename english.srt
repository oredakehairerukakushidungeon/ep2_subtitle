1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,520
Big Brother!

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,070
Y-You sure like to get up close
and personal, Alice.

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,570
Stare...

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,370
I wanted to share in your
good fortune, as well!

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,750
You were accepted into
the Hero Academy, after all!

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,300
R-Right...

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,780
You're basically the head
of our household now!

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,240
Alice, don't say that! My dignity!

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,880
F-Father!

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,270
I need to talk to you
about the Hero Academy.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,390
You see, there's an enrollment fee...

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,270
Enrollment fee?

13
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,850
I have some money saved up. How much is it?

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,100
Three hundred thousand rels.

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,320
Three hundred...

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,030
Within a week.

17
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,030
A week...

18
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,260
Will a year work?

19
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,940
Very well. I'll earn the money myself.

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,420
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

21
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,040
My poor, unfortunate brother.

22
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,390
Three hundred thousand rels
to get into the school, eh?

23
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,170
That's probably a bit harsh
for a poor noble like you.

24
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,470
I don't think you needed to be
that blunt about it, but yeah.

25
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:22,590
Then why don't you fight some rare monsters
in this dungeon and sell them off?

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,030
I'd rather not bring that
much attention to myself.

27
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,190
Especially after the entrance exam.

28
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,830
Could you just say it was you
who defeated the Dead Reaper?

29
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,110
What?

30
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,480
People would have an easier time believing
the daughter of an earl defeated it

31
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,140
than the son of a baronet.

32
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,450
Very well. I'll say that I defeated it.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,370
Thanks.

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,840
I ended up letting my vain classmate
take the credit for it.

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,220
Then I guess there's only one way.

36
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,340
Work at the adventurers' guild.

37
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,980
E-Excuse me...

38
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,100
What?

39
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:14,350
Sir, please don't intimidate the newbie.

40
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,240
I'm the receptionist, Lola.

41
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,130
Is this your first time
at the adventurers' guild?

42
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:07,510
#02 "The Guild and the Receptionist"

43
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,790
First, allow me to explain the
very simple system we use here.

44
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,760
S-Sure.

45
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,810
There are many prominent
adventurers who belong to Odin.

46
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,070
We have adventurers harvest plants,

47
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:24,070
cull monsters, explore dungeons,
and complete various other quests.

48
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,450
Adventurers have ranks, which
affect the quests they can take

49
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:35,330
Master

50
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:35,330
Newbie

51
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,360
and the rewards they receive.

52
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,330
Of course, those who show
consistent results may rank up.

53
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:41,170
In order to join the guild,
we'll need you to register.

54
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,220
Oh, sure. That'll be fine.

55
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,350
First, I'll need you to write down
all the skills you currently have.

56
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,450
My skills?

57
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,350
Have no fear.

58
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,350
All that information will be
classified with the guild.

59
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,860
She smells so nice...

60
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,700
I wrote them all down.

61
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,590
Er, Noir...

62
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,820
Y-Yes?

63
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,200
I'd appreciate it if you didn't kid around.

64
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,330
We don't have an endless supply of paper.

65
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,160
Oh, right. O-Of course.

66
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,110
I'm sure Get Creative and Editor
probably sound pretty weird.

67
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,800
No, I'm aware of those skills.

68
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,090
Because...

69
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,570
This is Odin, the guild that
Olivia Servant was a member of.

70
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,470
What?! Master was in this guild?

71
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,090
Master?

72
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,280
Crap! I let the cat out of the bag.

73
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,480
We do get people like you every now and then...

74
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,020
People who claim to be Olivia's successor.

75
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,190
In that case...

76
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,200
Let's find out the truth.

77
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,200
When you touch this Discerning Tome,
your skills appear in writing.

78
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,380
Well? What will it be?

79
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,220
You still have a chance to
take back what you said.

80
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,260
Oh, no. I'll go ahead and do this.

81
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,210
Huh?

82
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,210
But what happens if I'm not lying?

83
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,210
Well...

84
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:12,720
How about I lift up my skirt and say,
"I'm terribly sorry, Lord Noir."

85
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,150
Well, if you're sure...

S-So you're really...

88
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,740
Olivia's s-s-s-successor?!

89
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,200
So, what were you going to do again?

90
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,210
Weren't you supposed to say,
"Lord Noir, I love you"?

91
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,780
While lifting up your skirt.

92
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,670
L-Lord Noir...

93
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,220
I-I love you...

94
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,100
Noir Stardia

95
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,420
So, what kind of quest would you like?

96
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,660
You'll have to start at Rank E.

97
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,070
She got over that fast!

98
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,070
Actually, I need to get
300,000 rels in a week.

99
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,630
In that case...

100
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,150
How about catching these?

101
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,950
Rainbow grasshoppers?

102
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,180
Their habitat is known,

103
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,080
but they're super rare bugs
that are seldom seen, right?

104
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
This was a D-Rank quest,

105
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,870
but we started taking
E-Rank applicants, as well.

106
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,210
So I'm guessing you couldn't find
anyone to take the quest...

107
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,780
Correct. But, Noir, you have a useful skill

108
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,300
that should help you out.

109
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,100
Oh, you're right.

110
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,560
Good luck, Noir. I have very
high hopes for you.

111
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,060
I find capable men very attractive.

112
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,670
I-It's hard to believe she doubted
me a few moments ago...

113
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,200
The grasshoppers' habitat
should be around here.

114
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,110
If I use the Great Sage skill
that answers any question,

115
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,210
I should be able to find them quickly.

116
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,710
But kisses are absolutely necessary
to avoid the headache side effect.

117
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,850
Wait. If I use Get Creative
to make Headache Immunity...

118
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:18,970
Headache Immunity

119
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:18,970
LP needed to Get Creative:

120
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,820
That's so much!

121
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,970
But I can't always rely on Emma...

Okay, that should do it.

126
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,890
Great Sage, where are
the rainbow grasshoppers?

127
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,950
The closest one to this location is 310
meters to the south, behind a boulder.

128
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,730
Yeah, it definitely hurts.

129
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,870
But... it's not unbearable.

130
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,880
Sweet. I found it pretty quickly.

131
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,790
But headaches seriously suck.

132
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,370
It'd be nice to just have Emma here with me...

133
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,720
Noir, you doofus!

134
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,930
Emma! Perfect timing, as always!

135
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,660
And your boobs are still...

136
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,330
Noir, you became an adventurer?!

137
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,490
H-How'd you find out about that?

138
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,930
I went to your house,
and they said you went to the guild.

139
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,770
Then I went to the guild, and...

140
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,990
Actually, the details don't matter!

141
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,000
How could you do this
without talking to me first?

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,010
S-Sorry. I thought it might
be too dangerous for you.

143
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,840
Ugh! Don't you remember our
promise from six years ago?

144
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,720
Six years ago?

145
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,150
When we were playing together

146
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:41,140
and I yelled, "We'll be together forever,
until death do us part?"

147
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,290
Yeah. So I'll look for these
grasshoppers with you!

148
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,130
You'll be using Great Sage, right?

149
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,230
So, you know...

150
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,040
Oh, you don't have to kiss me anymore.
I learned Headache Immunity.

151
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,100
Huh?!

152
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,250
B-But, I mean, it's basically a greeting,
so you can give me one anytime.

153
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,770
And we've been friends forever.

154
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,010
And even with the immunity,
I still get a slight headache...

155
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,850
R-Really? In that case...

156
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,000
O-Okay.

157
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,800
Though, honestly, this headache
is quite manageable.

158
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,390
Thank you for your patience.

159
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,360
I have your 250,000 rels here.

160
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,950
T-Two hundred and fifty thousand?!

161
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,450
Yes. At this rate,
you'll rank up in no time.

162
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,860
G-Great.

163
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,820
So you're capable and hardworking.

164
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,740
You truly are a fine gentleman.

165
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,800
And because you're such a fine gentleman,
I have another quest for you.

166
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,980
It's a quest to take care of some monsters.

167
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,520
Th-Thank you very much.

168
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,470
Feel free to ask me any
questions you might have.

169
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,930
Hang on a second!

170
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,770
I'm going to become an adventurer
so I can come with you on this quest, Noir.

171
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,730
Y-Your boobs...

172
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,400
You? An adventurer?

173
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,980
The name's Emma Brightness. Noir and I
have been friends since we were kids.

174
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,380
Th-This can't be good...

175
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,360
The Hidden Dungeon Only I Can Enter.

176
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,000
C-Calm down, you two.

177
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,800
I'm in charge of Noir.
He is a valuable partner.

178
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,590
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't interfere.

179
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:48,520
That's my line. We're together forever,
until death do us part.

180
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,880
What's going on?

181
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,180
Are they having a lovers' spat?

182
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,810
Yeah! Fight more!

183
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,160
W-Well, this turned into a spectacle...

184
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,710
Emma! I'm so blessed
to have you help me out!

185
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,490
R-Really?

186
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:07,790
And Lola, I'll do whatever it takes
to give you the best results I can!

187
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,070
Oh, my.

188
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,850
I guess that's enough for today.

189
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,570
Yeah, I'll back off.

190
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,770
On behalf of Mr. Noir's looks.

191
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,770
On behalf of Noir's looks.

192
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,340
Aw, man.

193
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,400
They're done already?

194
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,670
Well, that was no fun.

195
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,590
Be safe out there.

196
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,110
Let's have dinner off the clock sometime.

197
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,760
Huh? I, uh...

198
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,430
You seriously had the nerve to
do that right in front of me?!

199
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,470
Noir, you doofus. Don't you know
girls can be conniving?

200
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,360
Go to dinner with her, and she'll
drag you into a room and...

201
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,030
A-And...?

202
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,120
Maybe she'll dissect you.

203
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,040
N-No way!

204
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,130
Hey, there's a patch of grass missing.

205
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,350
I wonder if it's because the Big Rabbit
that we're after ate some.

206
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,520
Yeah...

207
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,280
Apparently those rabbits are
disrupting the ecosystem.

208
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,550
We'll get 50,000 rels if we get rid of them.

209
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,320
Goblins?

210
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,040
What are their levels?

211
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,430
Goblin

212
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,430
The same as Emma. In that case...

213
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,200
Let's fight, Emma!

214
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,420
Yeah! I'll take the one on the right!

215
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,900
Goblin  Lv.17

216
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,900
Sex: Male

217
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,350
It's male.

218
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,070
Then I'll use Stone Bullet!

219
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,650
As a fellow guy, I feel for you, but...

220
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,690
Sorry, my dude!

221
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,490
Okay, now to back up Emma.

222
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,930
Noir, look!

223
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,810
A B-Big Rabbit!

224
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,890
Big Rabbit

225
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,890
Level 24.

226
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,860
S-Stand back, Emma!

227
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,030
Stay out of this. I'll defeat that thing myself.

228
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,400
What? But why?

229
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,280
Because...

230
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,640
If you do all the work, that girl's
going to be all over you again!

231
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,660
It's so fast for its size!

232
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,410
But Emma's even faster!

233
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,730
Yeah...

234
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,800
She's like a butterfly dancing on the wind.

235
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,670
You're way too slow.

236
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,960
All right, let's do this!

237
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,120
Wind Strike!

238
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,600
Wh-Whoa!

239
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,390
One more!

240
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,510
It jumped?!

241
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,510
I-I made it in time...

242
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,140
Emma! This way!

243
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,950
L-Let's regroup here.

244
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,290
It'll probably come looking for us soon.

245
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,620
We need to figure out how
to deal with that thing.

246
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,900
Why couldn't I defeat it?

247
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,780
I kept slicing at it.

248
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,790
Maybe its skin was too thick and
you just couldn't reach its vital point.

249
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,240
I'm so weak...

250
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,210
Emma...

251
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,800
She's actually depressed about this.

252
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,130
There must be something I can do.

253
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:58,680
Emma Brightness  Lv.17

254
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:58,680
Skills [Dual-Wielded Daggers (Grade C)]
Skills [Wind Strike]

255
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,090
Okay, if I use Get Creative

256
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:58,680
Dual-Wielded Daggers (Grade B)

257
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:58,680
Needed to Get Creative  LP.300
Bestow to Emma              LP.400
Total Used                       LP.700

258
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:58,680
————————————————

259
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,990
and Bestow the stronger Dual-Wielded
Daggers (Grade B) to her...

260
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,680
That's actually a lot.

261
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,020
Dual-Wielded Daggers (Grade C)

262
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,020
Improves wielder's handling of dual-wielded daggers

263
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,020
Using Editor to add "Significantly"

264
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,500
Then maybe I can use Editor
and tweak her skill itself...

265
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,690
Editor Results

266
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:07,690
Dual-Wielded Daggers (Grade B)

267
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:07,690
Significantly improves wielder's
handling of dual-wielded daggers

268
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,580
There we go! I got a discount!

269
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,690
LP used:

270
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,270
But wait...

271
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,290
I currently have 700 LP.

272
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,820
If I use 500 right now,
I might be in trouble.

273
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,970
H-Hey...

274
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,530
I could make you stronger.

275
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,990
R-Really?!

276
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,690
Yeah, but there's something
that I need in return.

277
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,720
I-If It'll help me defeat
the rabbit, I'll do anything!

278
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,670
Okay, then...

279
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,980
Can I nibble on your ear?

280
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,180
Huh?!

281
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,170
I-I promise I won't bite hard...

282
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,680
No?

283
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,010
S-Sure. Do whatever you want with me.

284
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,650
Emma...

285
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,570
Don't hold back!

286
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,030
I sure won't!

287
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,830
Wow... I didn't know ears were so soft.

288
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,930
Noir... Are you done yet?

289
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,380
Maybe her ears are sensitive.

290
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,320
We've been friends forever,

291
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,940
but I guess there's still a lot
I don't know about her.

292
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,300
N-No!

293
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,290
It spotted us!

294
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,630
Hurry... Hurry!

295
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,170
I need that LP!

296
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,510
Noir Stardia

297
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,200
I'm topped off!

298
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,470
Now to improve Emma's skill—

299
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,510
Stone Bullet 100.

300
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,160
Big brains, big skills.
Maybe size does matter sometimes.

301
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,660
Noir!

302
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,280
Now to use Editor to change Emma's skill!

303
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,670
Skills [Dual-Wielded Daggers (Grade C)]
Skills [Wind Strike]

304

Skills [Dual-Wielded Daggers (Grade B)]
Skills [Wind Strike]

306
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,920
Did you see that?

307
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,410
I-I did, but... I've actually
seen them plenty of times.

308
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:10,420
That's fine. You can keep looking
at them, just for today.

309
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,360
Huh?

310
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,500
It's to thank you... for making me stronger!

311
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,910
Th-This is truly... proof that
you completed your quest.

312
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,170
Did you really do this on your own?

313
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,150
Yes! Emma took down the
Big Rabbit all on her own!

314
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,000
Lola...

315
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,430
Um... Thank you.

316
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,160
I gained some confidence
because of this quest.

317
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,950
Oh, no... I apologize
for my prior rudeness.

318
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,590
Congratulations on completing your quest.

319
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,590
Oh, hey. I heard that Big Rabbit
flesh is delicious.

320
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,090
Yes. It's hard to come by.

321
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,110
I hear adventurers eat the meat
right after they defeat them.

322
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,920
Well, you see, I happened to created
a skill called Pocket Dimension

323
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,340
that allows me to store large
items in another dimension.

324
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,260
Let's all have some together.

325
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,320
Whoa!

326
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,570
That's great!

327
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,570
You're amazing at your job and considerate...

328
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,780
How wonderful.

329
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,640
You're the best, Noir!

330
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,090
It smells wonderful!

331
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,280
There's plenty more!

332
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,090
It's so good!

333
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,880
This is the best!

334
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,570
My meat!

335
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:55,100

00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,910
Oh, thank you very much.

341
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,370

for your enrollment fee now.

Wait... What is this?

348
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,870
It's like a dream... How did this happen?

349
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,390
Cheers to the adventurers of Odin!

350
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,180
Just call us if you need any help.

351

You should join my party next time!

352
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,080
What changed me?

353
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,390
How did I become stronger?

354
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,210
Who do I thank for this?

355
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,680
Oh, right.

356
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,410
This is all...

357
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,080
Noir, everyone's waiting to hear you speak!

358
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,130
Right.

Everyone, thank you so much!
